# SS-Homework

## Aug 29 - Sept 2nd
### Create a PR!
This week we're continueing our focus on Git and how to share code. In the very first exercise we're going to clone this repo and create a PR. Follow the steps below:

  1. clone this repo to your `Source` directory
  2. create a branch called `pr-homework-USERNAME` (please replace USERNAME with your username :) )
  3. create a new file called USERNAME.txt and write something in it (again, please replace USER with your username)
  4. commit your new file to your branch
  5. push your branch up to Github
  6. Create a Pull Request set to merge your branch w/ `main` 
  7. Add me as a reviewer

Good luck!
