// MAKE A BOOMBOX!
//
// Steps:
//  1. Create a new object (in this file) called BoomBox
//  2. Add a property for the `name` of the Boom Box
//  3. Add a constructor that has a String argument that will 
//    be stored in the `name` field
//  4. Declare a variable that will store if it's on or off. 
//    It should be off by default
//  5. After you store the name output to the user: 
//    "{NAME} the BoomBox has been created!"
//  6. Add a method to turn on the BoomBox
//  7. Create a new string array called `songs`
//  8. Create a method called `addSongs` that adds strings to 
//    our songs property (these should represent real songs)
//  9. Create a method called `playSongs()` that outputs the song
//    names to the user
// 10. Create a method called `turnOff`
// 11. Update `playSongs` so if the BoomBox is turned off instead
//     of outputting to the user the songs it instead says:
//     "{NAME} is turned off and cannot play any songs"
